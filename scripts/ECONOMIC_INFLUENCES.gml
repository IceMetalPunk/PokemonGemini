/// ECONOMIC_INFLUENCES(README! Do not use as a script!)
/*

As economics is a core theme of the game, the following are strongly recommended to be included:

Pay Day (the move)
Happy Hour (the move)
Amulet Coin (the item)
Luck Incense (the item... maybe? Seems strongly associated with Chansey/Happiny)
Item Maniacs (maybe?)

New concepts to fit the theme include:

Poke Centers on [Poor] Island cost money to use
Only potions/super potions are available on [Poor] Island; hyper/max potions are only on [Rich] Island
--> Similar for other tiered items, like revive/max revive, etc.
[Rich] Island has a "Pet Shop" of sorts, where you can buy Pokemon for lots of money [+shinies?]
--> [Poor] Island has a "PokePound", where you can get Pokemon for free, but they have lower stats than normal
"Nomad" trainer class in [Poor] Island, representing homeless people battling for their dinner
--> "Mogul" trainer class in [Rich] Island, representing rich people who don't need the money and just battle for fun

Pokedex given to you by Hawthorne to study $ made by Proof challengers; also tracks $ earned in each battle a Pokemon was used.
--> "Save" journal includes transaction list for shops, etc.
