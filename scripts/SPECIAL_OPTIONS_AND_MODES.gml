    There will be some special options in this game that don't exist in normal Pokemon games.
    
    Nuzlocke Options:
        - The options menu will have "Lock(e) Options: On/Off".
        - Turning it on enables all Locke options by default, but each option is individually togglable
        - Options include:
            - Fainted Pokemon are permanently sent to a graveyard (box)
            - Only the first encounter in each area may be captured
                - Exceptions for duplicate 'mons that you run from.
                - Exceptions for duplicate species that you run from.
                - Exceptions for static 'mons.
            - Every captured Pokemon must be nicknamed
            - If all Pokemon on your team die, you lose the game instead of whiting out
                - Only begins after you have your first Pokeball
            - Allow direct HM use if you have no Pokemon who can learn the HM.
            
    Boss Run Mode:
        - Unlocked when you beat the champion/"Greats"
        - Search for any 6 Pokemon to build a team, then battle all gyms/"Greats" in a row.
        - Team starts at all level 50; opponents auto-level-up like normal.
        - Before the start and after every 3 bosses, there's a Mart.
        - Beating this once unlocks "Starter Run", where you only get the 3 fully evolved starters
            - All level 50 to start
            - Opponents still all have 6 'mons
        - Beating Starter Run unlocks the use of 'locked rules for both run modes
        - Beating Boss Run earns you some prize(?) in the main game
            - Beating Starter Run earns you another prize(?) in the main game
            - Beating 'Locked Boss Run and 'Locked Starter Run each earn more prizes(?) in the
                main game.
            
    Super Safari Mode:
        - Unlocked when you beat the champion/"Greats"
        - Start with one basic 'mon that can be found early game
        - Go through consecutive areas of wild encounters, starting with 10 (15?) Pokeballs
        - You can't pass one area until you catch all the encounters in it
            - A "remaining encounters" counter shows on-screen.
        - Catching a 'mon earns you $$, as there are no trainers in this mode
        - Each area has a Pokecenter and Mart
            - Start with an Old Rod and Raft (for non-Pokemon surf)
            - Marts in later areas have better rods
        - Catching all the normal encounters in an area lets you encounter the "Rare Encounter"
            - It's somewhat rarer/stronger than the rest of the 'mons in the area
            - It must also be caught to progress to the next area
        - Each area has stronger 'mons than the last
        - These wild 'mons auto-level-up like important trainers in the main game
        - The last area has no wild encounters, and just static legends to capture.
        - Beating Super Safari unlocks "Super Locked Safari", which enforces most Nuzlocke rules
            - Losing at Locked Safari makes you start over from the beginning.
            - Locked Safari also makes the Pokecenters cost $$$ to heal.
            - Locked Safari only lets you catch one of each type of encounter per area
        - Beating Super Safari earns you a prize (master balls?) in the main game
            - Beating Locked Safari earns you another prize(?) in the main game
