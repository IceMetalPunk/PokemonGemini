** INTRO CUTSCENE: **

[Music: Avgvsta "Crossing the Rubicon"]
[Camera: Pans/zooms over montage of "Rich Island", all techy and whatnot]

[Music: fades into Avgvsta "Valentine #1"]
[Camera: Quick, motion-blurred pan over to "Poor Island", with a short montage]
[Zoom into hospital, pan past rooms, fade logo in and out while panning in the hallway]

[Music: continues looping Valentine #1]
[Camera: Stops at player at nurse's station]
Nurse: "All visitors must fill out a sign-in form. That's the rules, to keep the patients safe."

[Screen: the form "flies" from the desk up to the camera, and player can enter name and gender.]
[Screen: the form "flies" back onto the desk before continuing the cutscene.]

[Player: walks into a room]
[Camera: cuts to inside the room. Player is there with their mother in bed.]

Mom: "Don't worry, honey. Everything will turn out just fine."
Player: "But... how can we afford your medication?"
Mom: "I... I don't know. But please, don't fuss over me."
Player: "That's it. I'm going to complete my Proof and get us over to [Rich] Island! They can help you there."
Mom: "That's very sweet, darling, but... please, really, it'll all be okay."
Player: "It will. I'll make sure of it."

[Cutscene ends, camera fades out and in with player outside; if you try to go back in, the nurse
in front of the door tells you "visiting hours are over".]
