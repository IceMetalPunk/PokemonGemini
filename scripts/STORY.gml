Working story and concept:

In the Gemini region, often called the Twin Tropics, there are two major islands, Castor and Pollux.

The region's culture is such that one island (the opposite of the game's name) is reserved for only the strongest
trainers, while weaker trainers, non-trainers, and children are forced to live on the other, "starting" island.

The starting island is poor and fairly rural, while the high-class island is advanced, rich, high-tech, and advantaged.
However, the region's government "offers" anyone a place on the better island, as long as they can prove they're strong
enough to be there--through battling, of course.

The player is a young child whose single mother falls ill. They can't afford the medicine she needs, so Player goes off to
prove themself worthy of Rich Island, in hopes their family can live there and get their mother her treatment before it's too
late.

The first half of the game takes place mostly on Poor Island, as you work your way through the Gemini region's "Proof
Points" (gyms). It's mostly focused on that story--beating the gyms and proving yourself for your mom--but every once
in awhile, there are hints of corruption in Gemini's government. But you're just a kid, so you can't get involved.

At the end of the first half, you travel to Rich Island to take on four of the Gemini Greats ("elite four"), ending in
a battle with the Twins (a double-battle version of the champion battle). If you win, you and your family can move to
Rich Island, your mom gets her treatment, and you become a Gemini Great. Everything is good.

Then the second half of the game begins, ten years later. You're an adult now, your mother is elderly, and as a Great,
you're living a life of luxury. But things aren't as they seem; you've been suspicious of the Gemini government for
a little while now, and those hints from Part 1 of corruption come back to haunt you. You discover that the Gemini
government has been fixing the Proof Point battles, letting political allies into Rich Island and forcing out those
it deems "unworthy" or "untouchable" (a travel ban!). This has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people who died
in poverty when they could have made it to Rich Island and lived. In fact, some people who have discovered this secret
have even "gone missing".

You learn about a resistance movement, and you join it. But a Great resisting the government is very bad for the Gemini
image--the government is after you, you're after the government, and the conspiracy is afoot! You have to help the
resistance defeat the government and make Gemini a better place for everyone...or die trying.

STORY NOTES:
- The gov't is making people disappear, literally, using the legendary Pokemon Prestid, based on a magician. Its ability
  "Vanishing" makes it "phase out" and become invulnerable for one turn after it's hit by a move; in the story, this is how
  it makes things and people literally disappear out of reality. (It's male.)
- While Prestid is captured/controlled on Rich Island, the only way to stop the gov't is with the help of Ijitay, a legendary
    Pokemon from Poor Island. Its ability, "Retrieve", keeps things from going away (in battle, that means no moves with semi-invulnerable
    turns can be used, and perhaps also acts as Arena Trap). It can use this to bring back the things Prestid has vanished, and thus
    nullify its power and weaken the gov't enough to execute a coup. It's based on a magician's assistant, complete with
    detached body halves from being "sawed in half" :) (It's female.)
- In one game, you capture Ijitay and then use it to battle Prestid to defeat it. In the other, Ijitay battles Prestid on its own, and once
    it's weakened, you can battle & capture Prestid instead.
- Early-to-midgame, you can find a Mysterious Orb if you explore side-content. If you level up either Prestid or Ijitay while it's holding
    the Mysterious Orb, it'll "hatch" the orb (really an egg) into the pre-evo of them, Ilusi, whose gender is the opposite of the 'mon that
    hatched it. A male Ilusi will evolve into Prestid, and a female Ilusi will evolve into Ijitay; this gives you a way to get both legends in
    both games, if you explored enough to get the Mysterious Orb in the first place.
