/// FAKEMON_IDEAS(README! Do not use as a script!)
/*

Un-implemented ideas for custom Pokemon / Fakemon / Creatures:

LEGENDS:

Ilusi -> Prestid & Ijitay (see STORY document for information)
Ilusi = Psychic; Prestid = Psychic/Dark; Ijitay = Psychic/Fairy

STARTERS:

Fire = Some kind of phoenix. More flying-type than Torchic, and some kind of renewal symbolism
        between evolutions.
        
Water = Bunyip-based (Wiki "Bunyip"): "dog-like face, a crocodile like head, dark fur, a
        horse-like tail, flippers, and walrus-like tusks or horns or a duck-like bill
        
Grass = Something based on Yggadrisil; maybe growing new world branches each evolution?

OTHER:

Chareap (ghost) -> Grimmwar (ghost/dark): Event Pokemon found at graveyards. Based on grim
                                          reaper.
Signature ability: Reaper - If another 'mon is KO'd and you have this non-fainted 'mon
                    in your party, you may choose to have the other 'mon regain full HP
                    and this 'mon will faint instead. ("Grimmwar's Reaper activated! Revive %dyingMon%?")
Can only be found as event Pokemon, but there's one in each graveyard in Gemini.
