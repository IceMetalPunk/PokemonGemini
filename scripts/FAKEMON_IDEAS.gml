Un-implemented ideas for custom Pokemon / Fakemon / Creatures:

LEGENDS:

Ilusi -> Prestid & Ijitay (see STORY document for information)
Ilusi = Psychic; Prestid = Psychic/Dark; Ijitay = Psychic/Fairy

STARTERS:

Fire = Some kind of phoenix. More flying-type than Torchic, and some kind of renewal symbolism
        between evolutions.
        
Water = Bunyip-based (Wiki "Bunyip"): "dog-like face, a crocodile like head, dark fur, a
        horse-like tail, flippers, and walrus-like tusks or horns or a duck-like bill
        
Grass = Something based on Yggadrisil; maybe growing new world branches each evolution?

OTHER:

Chareap (ghost) -> Grimmwar (ghost/dark): Event Pokemon found at graveyards. Based on grim
                                          reaper.
Signature ability: Reaper - If another 'mon is KO'd and you have this non-fainted 'mon
                    in your party, you may choose to have the other 'mon regain full HP
                    and this 'mon will faint instead. ("Grimmwar's Reaper activated! Revive %dyingMon%?")
Can only be found as event Pokemon, but there's one in each graveyard in Gemini.

NEW ZEALAND BASED 'MONS:

- A psychic/dragon Tuatara 'mon, based loosely on the third "eye" on top of their heads.
- A normal or normal/flying type based on the kiwi, but NOT Doduo!
- A water/grass type based on the chevron skink, which burrow underwater but also climb forest vegetation.
- A water type based on Hector's dolphin, the smallest dolphin species and the only one with a rounded dorsal fin.
- A bug type based on the weta.
- A ghost/water(?) 'mon based on the Manaia, a mythical Maori creature described as a fish-bird-man, a serpent, a seahorse, etc. A messenger between humans and the spirit world
- A dark/fairy type based on the Patupaiarehe, a pale-skinned fairy-folk who play flutes, live in large communities, and sometimes attack humans.
- A water/ground type based on Taniwha, a whale-shark or shark-tuatara creature that lived in water but burrowed through the ground and uprooted trees in the process.
- A ghost/dark(?) type based on tipua, shapeshifters that looked like rocks, trees, etc., and demanded offerings lest they screw up the weather.
- A flying(?) type based on Mangoroa, a shark placed in the sky by the demigod Maui to create the Milky Way itself.
- A grass type based on tikis or the talking wood carvings in the story of Ruatepupuke, who went to rescue his son captured by Tangaroa, god of the sea. (He was only able to bring back the carvings that couldn't talk as Tangaroa's lair burned down, hence why modern carvings can't talk.)
- A normal/dark(?) type based on the Maero/Mohoao, violent wild-men with long, bony fingers and long, dirty hair. They kill prey with long, sharp fingernails, then eat them. Live in trees. Basically gorilla-bigfoot.
